# Project Overview

This project is setting up test suites for a feed reader application.


## Getting Started

Clone or download the repository. Then open the index.html file in your browser.


## Test Suites

Tests for allfeeds has been defined and that it is not empty
Tests for allFeeds have a url and that the url is not empty
Tests for allFeeds have a name and that the name is not empty
Search for the class of 'menu-hidden' in the body tag and checks that the menu is hidden
Toggles on click event if the menu appears or disappears
Tests if the loadFeed function has at least a single '.entry' within the '.feed' container
Tests to see if two entries are not equal


## Udacity Project Instructions
I have been given a feed reader application that works but needs testing integrated. Jasmine is already installed, so we can start adding tests. Complete the test suites above to make this a reliable application.
